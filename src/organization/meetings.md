# Meetings

We organize monthly online community meetings to discuss ongoing projects, share updates, and make decisions. These meetings are open to all community members, and we encourage everyone to participate.

Meetings take place on the last Wednesday of each month at 17:00 CEST. The meeting agenda and Zoom link are shared in the `#project-rusteomics` channel on the EuBIC-MS Slack workspace. If you are not yet a member of the Slack workspace, you can receive an invitation by [becoming a member of EuBIC-MS](https://eubic-ms.org/become-a-member/).
