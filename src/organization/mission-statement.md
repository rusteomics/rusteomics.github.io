# Mission statement

## Mission

Rusteomics harnesses Rustâ€™s performance, accessibility, and interoperability to power mass spectrometry-based omics data analysis. By fostering an inclusive community, developing robust core libraries, providing language bindings (e.g., Python, R), spotlighting complementary projects, and collaborating with groups such as HUPO-PSI and EuBIC-MS, we strive to deliver seamless, high-performance solutions for researchers worldwide.

## Vision

We aim to establish Rusteomics as the trusted reference for common tasks in mass spectrometry-based omics data analysis. Through broad adoption across diverse programming environments, we envision Rusteomics as a single, centralized platform where challenges are swiftly identified, addressed, and resolved through open, community-driven collaboration.
