## Criteria for introducing new features or projects

If you are considering proposing a new feature or project, please ensure that it aligns with the
goals and values of the Rusteomics project. In particular, we ask that you consider the following:

- **Scope**: The feature or project should be within the [scope of the Rusteomics project](./scope.md),
  which is focused on developing tools and libraries for mass spectrometry-based omics data
  analysis in Rust. If the feature or project is outside this scope, it may be better suited to
  another project or community.

- **Community interest**: Consider whether the feature or project is likely to be of interest to
  the Rusteomics community. Features that are likely to have broad appeal or address common use
  cases are more likely to be accepted.

- **Maintainability**: Consider whether the feature or project is likely to be maintainable in the
  long term. Features that are well-designed, well-documented, and easy to maintain are more likely
  to be accepted.

- **Compliance to Rust best practices**: Ensure that the feature or project follows Rust best
  practices, including using idiomatic Rust code, following the Rust style guide, and adhering to
  the Rust code of conduct.
